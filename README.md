# hello-world
I'm Keith Birchfield. I'm an environmental scientist with a strong background in data management and analysis. I'm trying to learn better ways to do data processing, analysis, visualization and whatever else this path opens for me. I'm getting pretty good at R and just recently learned about Github. This seems promising.
